## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile.

#### My name is NÃ­colas Matias!
Greetings! I am NÃ­colas Matias, and my journey in the world of technology began when I pressed the keys of a computer for the first time in my childhood. Since then, my passion for computing has led me to explore the endless possibilities of technology. Currently, I contribute as a Front-end and Mobile developer in a dynamic development team.

Linux is my passion, and alongside it, my heart lies in the fields of web development and machine learning. My personal projects reflect this passion, always revolving around these intriguing spheres. From crafting seamless web experiences to delving into the intricacies of machine learning algorithms, each project is a journey of discovery.

A notable aspect of my journey is the commitment to transparency and collaboration. My GitHub space serves as a playground where I explore ideas and share applications with the vibrant developer community.

### EXPERTISE

I am fluent in JavaScript and Python, and I continue to explore new technologies and trends in web development.

Additionally, I have participated in the development of applications using various technologies, such as Typescript, Java, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, PHP, and Flutter. These diverse experiences have expanded my knowledge and skills, enabling me to effectively tackle complex challenges.
